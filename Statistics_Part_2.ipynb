        "1. What is hypothesis testing in statistics?\n",
        "It is a method to test assumptions about a population using sample data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is the null hypothesis, and how does it differ from the alternative hypothesis?\n",
        "The null hypothesis (H₀) states no effect or difference; the alternative (H₁) suggests a significant effect or difference.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the significance level in hypothesis testing, and why is it important?\n",
        "It’s the probability of rejecting H₀ when it is true (commonly 0.05), determining the threshold for statistical significance.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What does a P-value represent in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "It shows the probability of obtaining the observed result if the null hypothesis is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. How do you interpret the P-value in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "If the P-value is less than the significance level, reject the null hypothesis; otherwise, fail to reject it.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What are Type 1 and Type 2 errors in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "Type 1 error: rejecting a true null hypothesis; Type 2 error: failing to reject a false null hypothesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between a one-tailed and a two-tailed test in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "One-tailed tests check for effect in one direction; two-tailed tests check in both directions.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the Z-test, and when is it used in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "A Z-test is used when population variance is known and sample size is large (n > 30).\n",
        "\n",
        "9. How do you calculate the Z-score, and what does it represent in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "Z = (X̄ - μ) / (σ/√n); it measures how far a sample mean is from the population mean in standard deviation units.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the T-distribution, and when should it be used instead of the normal distribution?\n",
        "Use T-distribution when the sample size is small (n < 30) and population variance is unknown.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the difference between a Z-test and a T-test?\n",
        "Z-test is for known variance/large samples; T-test is for unknown variance/small samples.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is the T-test, and how is it used in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "It tests whether there is a significant difference between sample means or a sample mean and a population mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the relationship between Z-test and T-test in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "Both test means, but differ in variance knowledge and sample size; T approaches Z as sample size increases.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is a confidence interval, and how is it used to interpret statistical results?\n",
        "It gives a range within which the true population parameter is expected to fall with a certain confidence level.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is the margin of error, and how does it affect the confidence interval?\n",
        "It is the range added/subtracted from a statistic; a larger margin gives a wider confidence interval.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. How is Bayes' Theorem used in statistics, and what is its significance?\n",
        "It updates the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence; important in decision making.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the Chi-square distribution, and when is it used?\n",
        "It's used for categorical data analysis, especially in tests of independence and goodness of fit.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the Chi-square goodness of fit test, and how is it applied?\n",
        "It checks if observed frequencies match expected ones; used in categorical data comparison.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the F-distribution, and when is it used in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "It’s used to compare variances, especially in ANOVA and regression analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is an ANOVA test, and what are its assumptions?\n",
        "ANOVA tests for differences among group means; assumes normality, equal variance, and independence.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What are the different types of ANOVA tests?\n",
        "One-way ANOVA, Two-way ANOVA, and Repeated Measures ANOVA.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the F-test, and how does it relate to hypothesis testing?\n",
        "F-test compares variances or multiple group means; it forms the basis for ANOVA."
